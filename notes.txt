!create - create a new command
	!create tts
	!create [message]
	!create player

!who - determines who created a specific command

need a list of commands that a user cannot create
example. Cannot say "!create create 'action'". 
base commands should be handled first. and possibly even display an error to the user when trying to 
create one of these reserved command words

* CANNOT DO .startswith for other commands. Need to parse entire and handle just incase
2 users do not create similar commands. ex. "!Type" & "!TypeThis" could be 2 separate commands
